abstract: "The discovery of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), in which two sheets of monolayer graphene are precisely stacked at a specific angle, has opened up a plethora of grand new opportunities in the field of topology, superconductivity, strange metal, and other strongly correlated effects. This review will focus on the various forms of quantum phases in MATBG revealed through quantum transport measurements. The goal is to highlight the uniqueness and current understanding of the various phases, especially how electronic interaction plays a role in them, as well as open questions in regard to the phase diagram."
